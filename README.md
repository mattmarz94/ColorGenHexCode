# ColorGenHexCode

This is a simple color scheme generator application using the color API.  
I used an input type of color to bring up the default color picker, and once you choose the color a seed color is chose. I send the seed color to the API, and will also send a request to the color API for a given color scheme chosen. The color API will then return a number of hex values which represent the colors in the chosen scheme.
Using this sequence helped me better my understanding of HTTP Requests and the fetch Method.
